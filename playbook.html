			You are interested in the Rock Your Dream project and want to bring the chair to your event, that is great! Please read the information below to ensure successful planning and execution.
			<ul class="list-unstyled py-5">
				<li><h2>Planning and Preparation</h2>
				<h5>Event Overview</h5>
				<p>Please send an email to xxx providing the team with an overview of the event &#40;Event Name, Date and Time, Location, Event, Purpose and Goals, Target Audience&#41;</p>
				<h5>Updating the Text and Audio of the Website</h5>
				<p>Since this website plays an important role in activating the chair, it's necesary to update the texts and audios to ensure that they relate to the event where the chair is going to be placed.</p> You can find <a href="xxx">here</a> a copy of the texts with the parts that need to be replaced highlighted. Please send an email to xxxxx at least 10 working days in advance of the day of the event with the texts that you want to add/replace &#40;for both the English and Dutch versions of the website&#41;.
				</li>
				<li><h2 class="pt-5">Logistics</h2>
				<h5>Transportation of the Chair</h5>
				<p>If the event is outside of Bread University of Applied Sciences, you are resposible for collecting and returning the chair to the University.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h2 class="pt-5">Operation and Execution</h2>
				<h5>Rules</h5>
				<p>The chair should not be used to eat, or drink, to just sit and hang around. If this happens, please kindly ask people to move and explain why.</p> 
				<h5>Instructions</h5>
				<p>Place the sign with the QR code next to the chair. Scaning the QR code will take people to the website where instructions on what the chair is for are given. However we recommend that you observe people's response and behaviour and provide additional help:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1. Observe the crowd at the festival and in particular those moving around the chair. Notice whether:
						<ul>
							<li>Festival attendees notice the chair</li>
							<li>What their behaviour is (they just look at it / take pictures of it / you hear them talk about it to their companion(s) / any other behaviour that seems to be directed to or triggered by the chair)</li>
							<li>Please take notes of all of the above.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>2. If you notice that:
						<ul>
							<li>People only look at the chair but do not sit or they scan the QR code but nobody dares to sit on it, then</li>
							<li>One of you does it (ie, scans the code and sits on the chair). The idea is that you do what they are expected to do in a natural way, without giving them the impression that you are mimicking their expected behaviour or illustrating what to do. The reason is that we believe they might feel embarrassed or scared to do something wrong, so seeing another person doing it, might lower the threshold for them to try out the same.</li>
							<li>If after some time (let’s say 20 mins), this also does not work, then gently invite a few of those gravitating around the chair to try it out, and explain them what it is about</li>
							<li>The explanation that you should give in this case, is that the chair is an experimental intervention developed by a local creative maker, Tim van den Burg, in collaboration with THE SPACE, an artistic platform from Breda University of Applied Sciences, and that the chair is intended to explore what people would like ‘t Zoet to become in the future.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>3.	Ask those you have invited to sit on the chair (NOTE: NOT those who sit by themselves) if you can take a picture of them while on the chair. Ideally, you ask them if you can take a picture of them with their own smartphone, so this is a memory for them, and then you ask if you can also take a picture of them sitting on it with your own smartphone, this picture would be used for our research. Reassure them in this case that this is for research purposes only and that the picture will not be published in the press, but they might be used in scientific publications. In this case, though, their face will be blurred so that they will not be recognisable
						<ul>
							<li>If they ask you for help, please offer it.</li>
							<li>Thank them at the end.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>4.	While people are on the chair, take notes of what you see – for example, they seem happy / enjoying it / scared / surprised; if they still seem not to know what to do / do not understand the instructions that are given; how long apprx they remain seated; if at the end they invite somebody (eg the person they are with) to try it out as well or if you get the kind of reaction they may share with them; and many more things you might notice. 
						<ul>
							<li>Please also note and report to us if they mention any issue with the audio or the text on the website, or any other issue related to the website, by being directed to it by scanning the QR code or any other technicalities.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>5.	Thank them at the end.</li>
